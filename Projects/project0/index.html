    <h1>Data Science definitions</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Hello World! I will use this webpage to explain some definitions of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I am also learning Web programming, so I want to practice programming together with Artificial Intelligence.</p>
    <p>So... let's start:</p>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence envolves machines achieving human-level performance at specific tasks (speech recognition, criminal detection, etc). Then it requires some imitation of the cognitive process of humans.
    As you might know, there are many subsfields and definitions and we need to clarify it before we get deep into the practice part.
    Here we have:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="WhatisML.html">What is <span <class="name">Machine Learning</span></a></li>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Definition</li>
            <li>Best MOOCs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      <li><a href="WhatisBD.html">What is Big Data</a></li>
      <li><a href="WhatisDS.html">What is Data Science</a></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Definition</li>
          <li>Best Data Science books</li>
        </ul>
      <li><a href="WhatisDL.html">What is Deep Learning</a></li>
    </ol>
